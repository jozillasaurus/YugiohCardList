### MVP/PostMVP
 
#### MVP 

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Styled using Flexbox or Grid
- Find external api
- Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM
- Render data on page
- Implement responsive design using media query/breakpoint (mobile)
- Deployed site to a hosting service like Github Pages
- Make commits to GitHub every day
- A README.md file that contains project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i
- When clicking on the card it gives you a larger version of the imgage that gives you a more readableresolutionto be able to read the description (some the the descriptions are essay length, that will throw off the flow of the cards organization when displayed on the screen).

#### PostMVP  
- Menu bar
- Deck builder
