### MVP/PostMVP
 
#### MVP 

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Styled using Flexbox or Grid
- Find external api
- Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM
- Render data on page
- Implement responsive design using media query/breakpoint (mobile)
- Deployed site to a hosting service like Github Pages
- Make commits to GitHub every day
- A README.md file that contains project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i
- Allow user to choose favorites

#### PostMVP  

- When clicking on the card it gives you a larger version of the imgage that gives you a more readableresolutionto be able to read the description (some the the descriptions are essay length, that will throw off the flow of the cards organization when displayed on the screen).


## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Sept 18-21| Prepare READ.ME to presesnt to team leader/Get project idea approved | Incomplete
|Sept 21| Start building the skeleton(HTML,JS)/ Test that my external API is connected and working | Incomplete
|Sept 22| Making sure I have all the right pieces I want(buttons, extension, side menu, etc.) Connecting info from API to where I want it to go   | Incomplete
|Sept 23| Using CSS (flexbox) to make sure cards do not overlap and are evenly spaced out in columns of 4 or 5 | Incomplete
|Sept 24| Media Query and any final bugs that might show up | Incomplete
|Sept 25| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
